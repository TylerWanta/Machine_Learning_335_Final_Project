# Machine Learning-335: Final Project
Final Project for Machine Learning

# Objective:
- To individually complete a thorough analysis of a data set of our choosing. 
- To demonstrate knowledge of a typical Data Analysis workflow

# About the Project:
- For our final project, we had to pick a data set and complete a few tasks.
- The tasks include:
  1. Breif overview of the data including what the variables mean and any interpretation. (aboutTheData.txt)
  2. Basic visualization of the data. (Visualize the Data.ipynb)
  3. Feature extraction (setUpData_part1.ipynb)
  4. Descriptive Regression - Where I analyze the data using regression tactics. (Descriptive Regression.ipynb)
  5. Predictive Regression - Using regression algorithms to create models. Most interesting in my opinion. (Predictive Regression.ipynb)
  6. Descriptive Classification - Where I analyze the data using classification tactics. (Desciptive Classification - CLustering.ipynb)
  7. Supervised Classification - Using classification algoritms to create models. (Supervised Classification.ipynb)
  8. Neural Network - Using a Neural Network on the data set. (CNN_fashionDataset.ipynb)
  
# Notes
- One thing to note, and that may be a little obvious, is that the data set used doesn't work that well with the tasks that were required. In other words, a lot of the tasks were geared more to a numerical analysis where as my dataset consisted of all images. I find a lot of interest in Convolutional Neural Networks, and as such, wanted to do a full analysis with images. Even though most of the tasks were kind of weird to work with, it was great for opening my eyes to non conventional feature extraction. 
- Second thing to note is that this was more of a "get your feet wet/ proof of concept" project rather than a "how optimzied can I be". In reality, I would've spent more time with the Descriptive tasks (finding trends/ analyzing the data) as well as optimzing the CNN at the end.
