I did name the data part1 because I intended to add some more on to it. The main thing I wanted was more information about the images so I could see if there were some trends base on similiar images. The main values I was going to add was number of vertical and horizontal lines in the images. But due to time constraints I wasn't able to get meaningful results and had to discard the idea.
